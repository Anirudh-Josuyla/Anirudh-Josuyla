Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in cloud computing, databases, and data pipelines, working with tools like AWS, Python, and SQL. Every project I work on is an opportunity to refine my skills and learn something new.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy unwinding with a good movie or diving into writing to express my thoughts and ideas. It's a way for me to stay creative and maintain a balance between my technical work and personal interests.

Coding is an art form. I don’t just see it as solving problems; it’s about creating something elegant, efficient, and innovative. Every line of code is a brushstroke that brings the picture into focus.

🌱 Continuous Learning
I’m always learning and evolving, whether it’s mastering a new technology or exploring how data can tell a better story. I stay curious and push myself to be better every day.
